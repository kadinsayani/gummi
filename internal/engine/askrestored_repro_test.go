// TestAnswerRestoredAskWithNoAgentMustNotSwallowIt locks the same contract

// path that reaches it without a resolver at all: a restored ask.
//
// A card parked on an ask_user question keeps the question (the durable
// decision_open row) but not the process. On restore, openAskFor re-arms
// the ask with no CallID, so the answer rides a turn — and no backend is
// behind the session to take one. The answer used to be taken, recorded
// and then refused ("queued, not yet running"), which consumed the
// question; later it was refused with the question put back, which on a
// face with no attach step (the web) left it unanswerable. The answer now
// brings the backend up itself and lands, as the driver's resume does.
